# Design Guidelines
## Follow Design Size System
Adhere to the design size system for mobile, tablet, and web to maintain consistency across different device sizes.

## Layout and Spacing
- **Element Distances**: Maintain distinct distances between elements within a group and between different groups to create clear visual hierarchies.
- **Use Even Numbers**: Use even numbers for spacing and sizing to maintain a balanced and harmonious design.
- **Uniform Spacing**: Ensure uniform spacing for different device sizes, for example:
  - Desktop: 10px
  - Tablet: 8px
  - Mobile: 6px
- **Grid System**: Employ a grid system to align elements and ensure consistency in layout and spacing.
- **Padding and Margin**: Apply consistent padding and margin values throughout the design.

## Typography
- **Font Sizes**: Use the same font size for both Arabic and English text to maintain consistency in bilingual designs.
- **Text Alignment**: Align text consistently, considering the directionality of different languages (left-to-right for English, right-to-left for Arabic).
- **Uniform Colors in Fonts**: Use uniform colors in fonts to maintain a cohesive and consistent look.

## Color and Contrast
- **Color Palette**: Use a consistent color palette throughout the design. Avoid using multiple colors to frame elements.

## Icons and Images
- **Icon Sizes**: Maintain uniform icon sizes within similar cards. Use SVGs whenever possible for scalability and clarity.
- **Image Source Size**: Keep the same image source size for both mobile and desktop. Adjust how the image is displayed, but maintain consistency in the source size.
- **Image Backgrounds**: Apply effects in separate layers when using image backgrounds to allow for flexible adjustments.

## Forms and Inputs
- **Input Fields**: Ensure consistent styling for input fields, buttons, and other form elements.
- **Validation**: Design clear and user-friendly validation messages and indicators.

## Navigation
- **Fixed Header**: Consider the location of the fixed header when designing any section to ensure proper layout and spacing.

## Buttons and Interactions
- **Button Styles**: Use consistent button styles (e.g., primary, secondary) throughout the application.
- **Hover and Active States**: Design clear hover and active states for interactive elements.

## Animations and Transitions
- **Subtle Animations**: Use subtle animations to enhance user experience without distracting users.
- **Performance**: Ensure animations do not negatively impact performance.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistency in animation styles and durations across the application.

## Additional Guidelines
- **Gradients and Alignment**: Avoid using alignment outside the frame when working with gradients.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use clear and consistent naming conventions for design files and layers to facilitate collaboration.
- **Figma Components**: Make sure to use Figma components to get border radius, such as using rectangular or frame components in Figma.
